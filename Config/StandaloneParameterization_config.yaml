Name: User Configuration for Standalone Parameterization
Comments: Is a subset of Sizing Tool config files as only parameters relevant to Standalone Parameterization are listed.


### PARAMETERIZATION SETTINGS ###
Sizing_Params:
    Num_freq_days: 1  # Number of representative daily frequency time series used in the simulation of one day
    Parameterization_granularity: 8  # Number of pRt values in the pRt range used for calc. loss & degr.cost coefficients
    Frequency_day_weighting: [ 0.99,  # Occurrence weights for representative daily frequency time series
                               0.01,  # Must match order of frequency files in InputData/Frequency (frequency_day1.csv,...)
                               0,  # Must sum up to 1
                               0, ]  # Must be larger or equal Num_freq_days

Controller:
  Class: "controllers.SizingToolController"  # Defines the controller which manages operation of storage units in simulation
  Parameters:  # Put static (i.e. not iterated) controller parameters here.
